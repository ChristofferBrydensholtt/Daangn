This project was to copy a famous Korean website and use it as a phishing site. I copied the layout of the original site using the HTTrack tool

I made a Java Spring project and using MVC built a web application.

I created a text file and any inputs in the login page was saved in this file.

This was not meant to be a thorough project, just a quick way of creating a phishing website and storing input.
